# PreyAndPredator
This project is a remaster of one of my old Projects I did for my cs class <br>
This never version is more focussed on genetics and which genetic sequenzes are beneficial and will further evolve <br>
Those Sequenzes decide or controll the prey and predators eating and social behaviour
